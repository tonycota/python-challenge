# python-challenge
submission for module 3 python assignment
Attached will be found both scripts for PyBank and PyPoll with Analysis and Resources folders containing the csv files and .txt files.

There was a slight problem with my initial repo; I had accidentally created a repo within a repo so I had to move files around and reclone the ssh into a new location,
hence why you see a couple pushes. 

Starting with PyBank:
We were given a data set including two columns with Date and Profit/Losses via a csv file.
With that data there is an output in the terminal and .txt file including:
Total months, total amount of money, average change, along with the greatest increase and decrease in profits with their respective values. 
Because there are empty rows in the budget_data.csv file, you will notice commented out lines 26-30, this was an attempt to figure out an index out of range error.
All outputs match the example photos the class was given in the directions. 
All of the final results can be found in the respective PyBank .txt file.

Regarding PyPoll:
Similar to PyBank, we were given a data set of an election containing columns listed Ballot ID, County, and Candidate. 
Using many functions including for loops, if statements, and numermous methods, the output for this script also matched the example the class was given in the directions. 
With the results we were able to conclude that Diana DeGette was the winner of the election with 73.812% of the total voting pool equating to 272892 votes. 
All of the final results can be found in the respective PyPoll .txt file.
